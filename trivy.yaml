# trivy.yaml
scan:
  # Target to scan, equivalent to the trailing '.' in your command
  # This is often implicitly the current directory if not specified or can be set via CLI still.
  # For 'trivy config', the target is usually passed as the last argument.
  # However, some global options can be set here.

# Options related to 'config' subcommand
config:
  # Equivalent to --exit-code 1
  exit-code: 1
  # Equivalent to --severity HIGH,CRITICAL
  severity:
    - HIGH
    - CRITICAL
  # Equivalent to --format table
  format: table
  # You could also specify output here if needed, e.g., for SARIF
  # output: trivy-results.sarif

# You might need to adjust the structure slightly based on the exact Trivy version
# and how it parses config files for specific subcommands like 'config'.
# It's common for 'scan' related options to be more prevalent in config files.
# For IaC specific scanning, you might use:
iac:
  severity:
    - HIGH
    - CRITICAL
  # ensure other iac specific options are here if available

# General options often available:
# severity: HIGH,CRITICAL # This might be a global fallback
# exit-code: 1
# format: table
